# Python - python is a high level, general purpose, object oriented programming language.
# It is an interpreted language. Guido van rossam has developed python language and released in the year 1991.
# It is free and open source language. 
# It is a case sensitive language, alphabets in lower case and upper case are considered as different characters.
# Python has different application like data science, data mining, web applications, mobile applications
# data visualization, machine learning etc.

# --------------------------- Datatypes -------------------------------------------------
'''
Data - A piece of information.

Datatypes - it is the classification of the data items.  
1. Numeric :
    1. integer - It is a whole number, it can be either positive, negative or zero but it does not include any 
    fractional part. e.g 10,14,1234566, -43, -587.
    
    2. float - it is a decimal number. e.g 23.0 , 44.4324 , -123.2341.
    
    3. complex -  It is used for working with complex numbers, here the imaginary part is represented by 'j'.
    e.g 4+ 6j, 2 + 4j.

    
2. Sequence : 
    1. string - It is a collection of characters (numbers, alphabets, special symbols and spaces) kept in 
    single or double quotes. It can have any number of characters or it can be empty also. 
    a string of one character is called a string of length 1.
    e.g. "" , "a", 'apple', "aljuboh1234@#34%^".

    2. list : It is a heterogenous collection of data items seperated by comma. It is mutable and 
    represented by []. e.g [12,14,18,"strings",,10.00,12.123,654].

    3. tuple : It is a heterogenous collection of data items seperated by comma. It is immutable and represented
    by () . e.g (10,122.123, "abhc", "xyz")


4. Boolean : It is a datatype with two values i.e True and False. 
    0 - False, any non-zero number - True, 
    empty string - False, non-empty string - True
    empty list - False, non-empty list - True
    empty tuple - False, non-empty tuple - True
    e.g True, False, 0, 1

5. Set : It is an unordered collection of unique elements/data items, It is mutable and does not allow any duplicates.
    it is represented by {}. e.g {10,15,12,13,15,16} --- {10,15,12,13,16}

6. Dictionary (dict) : It is an collection of data items which are kept in pairs (key-value pairs) 
    and every key value pair is seperated by comma. 
    e.g {1 : "one" , "two" : 2 , 3 : [1,2,3,4], 10.43 : 12345}

7. Binary Datatype : it is used for working with binary data. 
    1. memory view - 
    2. bytearray  -  
    3. bytes      - 
    string = "abc"
    bites = bytes("abc")
    array_bytes = bytearray("abc")
    memory_view = memoryview(array_bytes)
